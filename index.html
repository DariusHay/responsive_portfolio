                        <p class="d-inline">My name is Darius Hay, I was born in Palm Beach County Florida but was
                            raised in Brevard County Florida. I grew up in gret family where I learned to treat everyone
                            with respect from both my father and mother. I also learned the qualities of working hard
                            and being deligent in life's desires. <br><br> I have grown a passion for web development
                            and I am currently enrolled to the Coding Bootcamp at UCF. This Bootcamp has been a Blessing
                            to me and has help me excel in my knowledge as a web developer. I have learned coding
                            languages such as, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and Node.js. I have also learned how to use
                            API's and 3rd party styling frameworks such as Bootstrap and Materialize. <br> <br>
                            I still have about 4 months left in this bootcamp and have come a long way from the day I
                            began. The support from my instructors in this course has pushed me to learn at a pace that
                            gives me great confidence that I will be employer competitive by the end of this course. I
                            am also working with a great group of peers that I am learning along with in this course. I
                            am determined and committed to completing this course with excellence and going above and
                            beyond in my learning.
